            I served in my local church for two and a half years. My various
            roles were Children's Pastor, Young Adults Pastor, and
            responsibilities as required, which really just meant whatever else
            was needed at the time. I learned how to use different equipment,
            like a sound board, and how to run a conference and organize a team.
            Most of all I learned how to lead people in their faith while not
            letting my own faith slip away.

            After serving in the church I wanted to take some time to try and
            develop myself even more. I felt like I became a pastor too soon.
            That I wasn't given the ability to develop the character necessary
            to succeed in the long run. I didn't feel like I was a man that was
            above reproach, as the Bible showed, and I knew I wasn't. So now I
            am trying to become that man. I am learning a skill, working hard
            with my hands, gaining the respect of outsiders, and loving all that
            I can while learning to be loved myself.

            The future is a mystery. But I know whatever the future might hold I
            will be pursuing Jesus with all my heart like I have been. I would
            love to plant a church someday, have it funded by donations with the
            tithe from the people going straight back to them to help bolster
            the community and their own lives. A place where fellowship is key,
            with Jesus and each other. <br />
            I plan on calling it, Christian Fellowship.
