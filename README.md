# portfolio
My built from scratch portfolio for my college class, web development. 

This portfolio showcases my ability to create a functional, front-end website, with HTTP requests to the server through forms. The main focus was a wide varriety of HTML tags, CSS, and some jQuery. Responsiveness was a secondary focus, with design being the third and lowest focus.
